# Arrays 
 - **Fixed Size:** Once created, an array's size cannot be changed
 - **Zero-Based Indexing:** Array indices start at 0
 - **Homogeneous Elements:** All elements must be of the same type
 - **Random Access:** Index can access elements directly in O(1) time

# 2-Dimensional Arrays
 - **Nested Structure:** Consists of multiple arrays arranged in rows and columns
 - **Indexing:** Accessed using row and column indices
 - **Traversal:** Can be traversed row by row or column by column
 - **Jagged Arrays:** Can have different numbers of rows and columns
 - **Good choice for matrix** (grid or table use cases)
 - **Ideal for board games** (chess board, Conways Game of Life, etc.)
